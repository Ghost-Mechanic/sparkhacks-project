Inspiration

We were inspired by the growing disconnect between small food businesses and their local communities. Many small eateries struggle to gain visibility, while food lovers often miss out on hidden gems in their area.
It's difficult to find what you don't know exists. We wanted to create a platform that bridges this gap, recreating the fun of swiping and the thrill finding a match—like on Tinder. 
BiteSwipe is our solution to help small businesses thrive and food enthusiasts explore new flavors.
What it does - BiteSwipe is a dual-purpose app designed for both food lovers and small businesses

For Users:

  - Swipe through local food spots to save favorites or explore new options.
  - Build a friend list to share recommendations and plan food adventures.
  - You're going out with a friend group or a date and can't decide where to go? Connect with your friends and swipe together! Once both of you swipe on the same restaurant, it's a match!

For Businesses:

  - Create a profile to showcase their menu, photos, and story.
  - Gain insights into customer demographics (age, location, food preferences etc.) to better understand their audience.
  - Advertise promotions and updates directly to users and post updates about your business.

How we built it

Frontend: Built with React. Backend: Flask, SQLite3. Wireframes made with Figma.
Challenges we ran into

Time constraints, thinking big but only having enough time to code the MVP. Linking the backend user creation and data storing to the frontend UI.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

  - Successfully creating a functional swiping mechanism that’s both fun and intuitive.
  - Building a dual registration system for users and businesses, each with tailored features.
  - Being able to send any registered user a friend request.
  - Designing a clean, user-friendly interface that appeals to both food lovers and small business owners.

What we learned

Working in a team taught us the importance of clear communication and task delegation. We also learned to break down complex problems (like the matching algorithm) and gained a deeper understanding of how to design features that cater to two distinct user groups (users and businesses). Most importantly, we had to very quickly learn how to use React, Node.js, and database management in less than 24 hours.

What's next for BiteSwipe:

  - Make it mobile compatible, because often times you're out in the city looking for something to eat - not with a laptop out at home.
  - Introduce AI-based recommendations to suggest businesses based on user preferences and swiping history.
  - Provide businesses with more detailed insights, such as peak swiping times and customer retention rates. Also possibly add a button for the user to say they actually went to the business after swiping on them, so businesses can see who actually went in person as well.
  - Expand the Forums page where users can post reviews, photos, and recommendations.
  - Scale the app to include more cities and regions, helping small businesses everywhere connect with their communities.
